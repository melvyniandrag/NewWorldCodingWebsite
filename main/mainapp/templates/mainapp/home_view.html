                <h1> Mission Statement</h2>
                <p> These things aren't useful without expert guidance. A 4090 RTX with 24GB RAM?  An M4 Max Macbook Pro? A $2000 3D Printer? A case full of Raspberry Pis? It's easier to buy these things than it is to use them as they're intended to be used.</p>
                <p> At New World Coding we not only have all the latest and greatest hardware you can buy, but we have amazing classes where you can learn how to use these things as well. We can teach you how to run amazing things on both the humblest, most energy efficient microcontrollers and also run massively parallel, electricity guzzling programs at blazing speeds. Come take a class with us and let us show you just how amazing technology really is.</p>

                  <p> But that's not the case here. At New World Coding you'll be learning from real, full time programmers who work or have worked at respectable companies. You'll be learning from people who have had some good amount of success in industry, which means we can teach you all the real important details of the business. We also develop our own software in house. Be sure to check out the gallery of software for examples of cool programs we've written.</p>
